## 10 popular commands - daily use

- **touch** : It is used to modify the 'access time' & 'modification time'.  To modify only "access time" use "-a" option and to modify only "modification time" use "-m". If a **file doesn't exist** it creates a new file with that name. So, touch command **can be used to create a new file**.


```bash
touch filename #creates a new file, if doesn't exist
touch -a filename # modify only the access time
touch -m filename # modify only the modification time
touch -c filename # prevent creation of new file, if it doesn't exists
```

- **mkdir** : It is used to create a new "directory" (folder).  you can pass in **-p** option to create whole path, if the parent folder doesn't exists.

```bash
mkdir foldername # creates a new folder/directory
touch -p parentfolder/childfolder # create folder 'parentfolder' if it doesn't exits.
```
